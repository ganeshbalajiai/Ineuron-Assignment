1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Answer: True,False

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Answer: and, or, not

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
Answer: This will return all possibilities:
code:
l1 = [True, False]
for_and = set()
for_or = set()
for_not = set()
for i in l1:
    for_not.add((i,not(i)))
    for j in l1:
        for_and.add((i,j,i and j))
        for_or.add((i,j, i and j))
print(list(for_and), list(for_or), list(for_not))
return: [(True, False, False), (False, False, False), (True, True, True), (False, True, False)] 
        [(True, False, False), (False, False, False), (True, True, True), (False, True, False)]
        [(True, False), (False, True)]

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) Ans: False
not (5 > 4) Ans: False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) Ans: True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) Ans: False
(True and True) and (True == False) Ans: False
(not False) or (not True) Ans : True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
Ans: ==,!=,>,<.>=,<=

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
Ans: (before answering , i this equal to refers to double equal to. because single equal to belongs to assignment operator.)
    assignment operators are used to assign the values eg, x = 2, x +=2, x-=2
    double equal to are used to check the two values whether they equal or not eq, if x = 2 and y = 2: print(x == y) returns true

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10: #(first block)
    print('eggs')
if spam > 5: #(second block )
    print('bacon')
else: #(third block )
    print('ham')
    print('spam')
    print('spam')

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
code:
if spam ==1:
    print("Hello")
elif spam == 2:
    print("Howdy")
else:
    print("Greetings")

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
Answer: CTRL + C

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Answer: break stops the loop and get out from that loop.
        Continue stops the below operation in the loop and go abow to perform the further conditions of the loop.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Answer: These all three doesnt make any differences. all the represent the same.
    range(10): it automatically consider the range from 0 to 10 with 1 stepsize.
    range(0,10): in this we manually provide the starting and ending but automatically takes the stepsize 1
    range(0,10,1): in this we manually provide all things.

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
Code for for loop:
for i in range(1,11):
    print(i)
Code for while loop:
a = 1
while a<11:
    print(a)
    a+=1

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
Answer: from spam import *
        bacon()
